## Wordle-Solve PRO

**Wordle-Solve PRO** is a project created to solve all Wordle games, utilizing the word list provided by [1eez](https://github.com/1eez).

### How to Use:

1. **Input the word length**:  
   Begin by entering the length of the word you're guessing.

2. **Submit the feedback information**:  
   Based on the feedback from Wordle, submit the following information:
   - **Letters in known positions**: Input the letters whose positions you know. Use an underscore (`_`) or a space to represent unknown letters. For example, if the word is `a__le`, it means `a` is in the first position, and `le` are in the fourth and fifth positions. If you don't know any letters, simply press `Enter` to skip.
   - **Letters present but in unknown positions**: Input letters that are present in the word but whose positions you do not know. You don't need to separate them with spaces. If there are none or if you're unsure, press `Enter` to skip.
   - **Letters that are not present**: Enter the letters that you are sure are not in the word. If you're not sure, press `Enter` to skip.

3. **Choose whether to continue filtering**:  
   After the program recommends the optimal word based on your inputs, you can choose to continue filtering or end the process.

With **Wordle-Solve PRO**, you can intelligently and efficiently narrow down the word possibilities and solve Wordle puzzles with ease!
